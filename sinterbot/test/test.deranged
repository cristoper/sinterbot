# This is an example configuration file for SinterBot2020. The configuration
# file contains the list of secret santa participants and other options. It is
# processed by the `sinterbot generate` command to produce a random derangement
# in a new file; invoking the `sinterbot send` command on the deranged file
# will then send (or resend) an email to each participant informing them who
# their secret santa is.

# If a line is blank or the first non-whitespace character is '#' then it is ignored.

## Santas ##
#
# Participants are listed in the form "name: email". The name is for display
# only and need not be unique; the email must be unique:

Santa A: user1@email.tld
Santa B: user2@email.tld
Santa C: user3@email.tld
Santa D: user4@email.tld
Santa E: user5@email.tld

## Constraints ##
#
# A line beginning with 'mincycle:' specifies a minimum cycle constraint. The
# default is 2; if it is set to a value less than 2 it will be ignored.
mincycle:3

# A line beginning with '!:' indicates a blacklist constraint. It must be
# followed by two comma-separated email addresses from the Santas list. The
# blacklist constraint guarantees that the generated secret santa assignment
# will not assign either Santa in the list to each other.
!:user2@email.tld,user4@email.tld
!:user2@email.tld,user1@email.tld
